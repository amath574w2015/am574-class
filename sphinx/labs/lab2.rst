Lab 2: Friday, Jan. 16, 2015
=============================

We will be using IPython notebooks in this lab, so please make sure you can
open a notebook on your laptop, or on SageMathCloud.

See :ref:`python` for some references and tutorials for Python and notebooks.

Obtain the IPython notebook we'll be using via::

    cd $AM574   
    git pull

    cp -r $AM574/labs/lab2 $MY574
    cd $MY574/lab2

then open the notebook `$MY574/lab2/AdvectionTests1.ipynb`.


**Note:** This assumes you have defined the environment variables `$AM574`
and `$MY574` as suggested in last week's lab (:ref:`lab1`).   See 
:ref:`class_repos`, which now summarizes how to do this.
