Lab 2: Friday, Jan. 16, 2015
=============================


We will be using IPython notebooks in this lab, so please make sure you can
open a notebook on your laptop, or on SageMathCloud.

See :ref:`python` for some references and tutorials for Python and notebooks.

Obtain the IPython notebook we'll be using via::

    cd $AM574   
    git pull

    cp -r $AM574/labs/lab2 $MY574
    cd $MY574/lab2

then open the notebook `$MY574/lab2/AdvectionTests.ipynb`.


**Note:** This assumes you have defined the environment variables `$AM574`
and `$MY574` as suggested in last week's lab (:ref:`lab1`).   See 
:ref:`class_repos`, which now summarizes how to do this.

**Material added after lab:**

- A version of the notebook with sample solutions to the questions posed 
  is now in `$MY574/lab2/AdvectionTestsSolutions.ipynb`
  and can be viewed `here
  <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/faculty.washington.edu/rjl/classes/am574w2015/_static/AdvectionTestsSolutions.ipynb>`_.
