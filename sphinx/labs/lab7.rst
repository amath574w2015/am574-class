Lab 7: Friday, Feb. 20, 2015
=============================

- Next week: No lecture on Wednesday, Midterm on Friday Feb 27.

- Office hours next week: M 1-2, T 3-4, W 11-12.

- Some review topics for the midterm can be found at :ref:`midterm`.

The IPython notebook 
`$CLAW/apps/notebooks/riemann/shallow/ShallowWaterRiemannProblem.ipynb`
illustrates solutions in the phase plane for the shallow water equations.
You can `view the notebook via nbviewer 
<http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rjleveque/8994740>`_, but to change the
data and re-execute cells, you will need to be running the notebook.

I will discuss genuine nonlinearity and approximate Riemann
solvers, following the 
`2011 slides <http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/classes/hyperbolic2013/am574w2011/index.html>`_ 
for Lectures 17 and 19.
