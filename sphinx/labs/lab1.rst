Lab 1: Friday, Jan. 9, 2015
=============================


- Read the section :ref:`software_installation`, and try
  installing the necessary software, in particular Git and the Python
  plotting package matplotlib.

- We will not be using Clawpack yet.

- If you are not familiar with Git, follow some of the links on the page
  above to learn a bit about how to use it.  

- The lab session will consist of a brief introduction to Git and time to 
  answer questions and/or help with software installation.

- You might also want to create an account on SageMathCloud if you don't have
  one already, particularly if you don't have the required software on your
  laptop (see :ref:`smc`). 

- Please complete 
  `this survey <https://catalyst.uw.edu/webq/survey/rjl/257053>`_ 
  on your background.
