Lab 8: Friday, Feb. 27, 2015
=============================

- This lab session will be used for the midterm exam.


- The directory `$AM574/labs/lab8/shallow_1d_example1`
  has some sample code for solving the shallow water equations using the
  Roe solver.  This is discussed in `this video
  <https://panopto.uw.edu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=eb9eb4aa-78a4-9ba9-b14a-681ab287263b>`_.

- That directory also contains an IPython notebook `SW_riemann_tester.ipynb`
  illustrating the exact Riemann solution and the Roe approximation for the 
  shallow water equations.   This makes use of two other Python modules also
  in the directory: `SW_exact_Riemann_solver.py` and `SW_phase.py`.

- You can `view the notebook via nbviewer
