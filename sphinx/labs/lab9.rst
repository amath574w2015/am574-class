Lab 9: Friday, March 6, 2015
=============================

- Using an IPython notebook to present Clawpack results and for a slideshow:

  The directory `$AM574/homeworks/hw3/expflux/ExpFlux.ipynb` now
  contains a modified version of the notebook presented as a solution to 
  Homework 3.  This will be discussed.

- If you want to enable slideshow mode for your notebooks, you might need to
  follow
  `these instructions <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fperez/nb-slideshow-template/blob/master/install-support.ipynb>`_.

- Most of the lab period will be used for groups to discuss projects.
