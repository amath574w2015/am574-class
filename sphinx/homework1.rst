(Instructions for doing this will be posted soon.)

- `hw1.pdf <_static/hw1.pdf>`_

- See :ref:`hwformat` for a discussion of formatting.  Please use latex if
  possible for the analytical questions.

- If you want to use latex for your solutions, you can start with the file
  `hw1.tex`, which includes commented-out sections where you can insert
  solutions.  This can be found in the class repository (see
  :ref:`class_repos`).
