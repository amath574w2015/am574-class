Outline and reading assignments
=============================================================

There is a lot of material to cover (see :ref:`info` for an overview of
topics and goals).  Since there are only two 50-minute
lectures per week (and two Monday holidays), it will not be possible to
cover everything in detail in lectures.  

The textbook covers many details that will be omitted from lectures.  You
should read the relevant sections *before* lecture and come with any
questions you have about the material.

There will also be assignments related to the Friday lab sessions, see
:ref:`labs`, or the links below.
